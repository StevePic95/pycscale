# TODO:
* Develop standard format for CSV used to make the ticket_table (must include all columns necessary to fill all Ticket object attributes)
	* Write function to compile this CSV from standard PC Scale reports
* Add ability to process quadruple-split loads (never happened yet, but could in the future)
